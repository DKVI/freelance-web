The demand for specialized communication in Vietnam's various fields is increasing, necessitating specialized institutions with modern curricula.
In the age of technology and digitalization, finding professional communication institutions with modern curricula and teaching methods that keep pace with global trends is not easy, despite communication management being a well-established field in Vietnam.

Communication in general refers to the capacity to initiate and exchange messages among various parties.

This sector educates students on theories and practical applications of tools used in communication, enabling them to understand messages, contexts, audiences, target groups, and organizations more accurately.

While the study of communication is well-established in Vietnam, having been integrated into the curricula of numerous public universities, contemporary shifts in the global economic landscape have increased the high demand for a more specialized focus within the communication area, notably in the field of Professional Communication.

In short, Professional Communication focuses more on the theories and practical applications of communication in professional environments. It encompasses highly specialized fields such as business, investment, consulting, education, healthcare, sports, law, and more.

In these areas, there are diverse groups of customers and audiences with distinct characteristics, requiring tailored approaches for optimal effectiveness. This is where experts in Professional Communication are sought after and valued.

During the nascent stages of communication development, most interaction channels were predominantly one-way.

In this scenario, media outlets disseminated information while audiences consumed it.

Currently, as digital platforms burgeon and public opinion is equipped with various tools to access information and express viewpoints, mastering communication principles alone is not sufficient for the new generation of professional communicators.

They must possess diverse knowledge, an understanding of macro-information, political, and socio-economic situations, and the ability to grasp the psychology of target audiences to articulate and coordinate messages accurately.

They need to master digital tools to efficiently manage information streams across multiple channels.

Mastering communication principles alone is not sufficient for the new generation of professional communicators.

To fulfill these tasks, their skills must be comprehensively honed, from developing multimedia communication strategies and crisis management to building relationships.

There are numerous real-life examples illustrating how businesses thrive through well-planned communication efforts.

Conversely, some brands have collapsed due to mishandling communication crises. Hence, the allure of skilled and adept professional communicators is increasing, becoming an indispensable part of business operations.

However, compared to the global landscape, the number of professional communication training institutions in Vietnam offering continuously updated modern curricula and teaching methods is relatively scarce.

In the race to provide quality professional communication programs, the new generation of internationally accredited universities holds a significant advantage. Among them stands the British University Vietnam (BUV) with its Bachelor of Arts (Honors) in Professional Communication (Business, Design & Strategy), awarded an honorary degree by the Arts University Bournemouth (AUB) in the U.K., a strategic partner of BUV, after 3 years of training.

Arts University Bournemouth (AUB), with over 140 years of history, is renowned as the "cradle" of arts, design, and communication education in the U.K.

It has achieved Gold Standard certification for outstanding teaching quality by the Teaching Excellence Framework. AUB's entrepreneurship graduate rate ranks among the top 16 universities in the U.K.

In collaboration with BUV in Vietnam, AUB's program combines strategic business principles with creative practical methods. Students will learn through diverse experiences, utilizing various communication techniques and presentations to gain practical experience.

Importantly, networking activities within the training framework will connect students with partners, experts, and businesses in the communication industry.

Many program courses will be linked to the partner network, providing students with opportunities to collaborate and maintain close relationships in the industry during their time as students.

"The program is scientifically designed, providing students with fundamental skills in the first year and allowing them to carry out practical exercises and projects in the second and third years. By the end of the third year, students are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary for professional communication specialists, understand the industry, and are ready to enter the real-world job market," said Lisa Mann, Executive Director of Academic Innovation at AUB.

Overall, in addition to benefiting from advantages while studying at BUV, students of the Professional Communication program also enjoy enduring and classic creative values, as well as mastering the latest trends in communication within just 3 years of training.

British University Vietnam is the first and only higher education institution to be certified with an overall rating of 5 stars on the following criteria: Teaching, Employability, Academic Development, Facilities, Social Responsibilities, and Inclusiveness.

The curriculum at BUV makes breakthroughs by continually updating trends and market demands, combining theory and practice, ensuring internship opportunities in various fields starting in the second year, and maintaining a 100% employment rate within 3 months after graduation.

The campus, spanning 6.5 hectares with a total investment of US$165 million, is designed according to green trends, ensuring outstanding experiences both inside and outside of class and comprehensive development in both academics and physical health for generations of students.
