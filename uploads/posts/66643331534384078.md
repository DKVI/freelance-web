Teams from University College Dublin, the University of Galway, the University of Warsaw, the University of Basel, Ukrainian Catholic University and Humboldt University of Berlin will go head-to-head at the Dublin Dispute Resolution Centre from 3–5 March 2023.

This year’s problem is a topical issue on the use of drones.

The procedural questions look at whether the arbitration agreement was validly entered and thus, whether the tribunal has jurisdiction. If the tribunal does have jurisdiction, should the tribunal stay or alternatively bifurcate the proceedings. The substantive matters look to whether the CISG applies to the contract and if so, can the domestic contract law be applied.

Megan Fanning, a trainee solicitor at Eversheds Sutherland, is organising this year’s Dublin Vis Pre-Moot, which is being sponsored by the Dublin Dispute Resolution Centre, The Bar of Ireland and Arbitration Ireland.

Later, from 31 March–7 April 2023, nearly 400 teams from around the world will meet for the 30th Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot in Vienna, the first in-person version of the event since the 26th edition in 2019.
