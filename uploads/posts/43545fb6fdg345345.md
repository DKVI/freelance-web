A message from our Founder
Welcome to Mooting Summer School (MSS). 
I believe that mooting is an activity every law student should experience at least once in their law school life. From a professional perspective, this is a challenging playground that not only helps you practice critical thinking, improve your research skills, but also expand your understanding of the law. Additionally, mooting is an opportunity for you to meet and interact with incredible people in the industry, people with the same passions and hobbies, or even people who might be your “future colleagues.”
Loving and understanding your subject is always an important factor in any conquest. Therefore, at MSS, as the founder and instructor at MSS, I aim to help you “love” and “understand” mooting more through lectures, tips, and shared stories. And then, even if you conquer a moot competition or not, you can still become an inspiration and guide for the next generation of mooters. This way, we can all contribute to improving the quality and overall level of the mooting community in Vietnam.
Thank you for allowing MSS and me to accompany you on your mooting journey. I hope to see you at MSS.

Our Mission
In recent years, mooting has gained popularity in law schools over the last five years. However, the moot community lacks generalization, systemization, and inheritance in its development. Mooters are not typically professionally trained or led, resulting in many challenges and obstacles when competing in moot competitions, domestically and internationally.
Given this context, MSS was established with the hope of laying the foundational bricks for the sustainable development of the community. As the first professional training project in Vietnam, MSS aims to provide its learners with three core values, as follows:
To master foundational skills to achieve high efficiency when participating in mooting competitions; 
To build appropriate mindset, spirit, and attitude when participating in mooting;
To spread and develop a sense of community in mooting.
About the symbol and title of MSS
The symbol of MSS
Gryffin, also known as "điểu sư" in Vietnamese, is a mythological creature with the head, wings, and talons of an eagle and the body, tail, and hind legs of a lion. Because the eagle is considered the "king of birds" and the lion is the "king of beasts," the Gryffin symbolizes strength and wisdom in many ancient cultures such as Persia, Greece, Egypt, India, and so on. 
MSS chose the Gryffin as its emblem for the project because both halves of it are closely connected to MSS. With the eagle half, it evokes a part of the name of the founder's first moot team. Meanwhile, the lion half symbolizes the courage and bravery of mooters in general throughout their competition journey.

MSS Philosophy
“Non est ad astra mollis e terris via”, roughly translated as "There is no easy path from the earth to the stars," seems to be a fitting metaphor for the challenges one faces in mooting. Because indeed, mooting can become a "lucky star" and positively change someone's future in the legal profession. However, to harvest such a star, mooters must endure many difficulties, even failures time and time again. MSS chooses this as the project's philosophy, firstly to remind itself of the mission to lay a foundational stepping stone for students to continue their journey in conquering mooting. Moreover, through this philosophy, MSS also wants to convey to students that the path with mooting is arduous and lengthy, so they should remain determined, yet not be discouraged. After all, MSS believes that you will always gain the deserved value from this journey for the effort you’ve put in.
